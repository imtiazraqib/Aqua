# Aqua
Automated Quest at University of Alberta, or Aqua for short, is a Facebook Messenger chatbot that utilizes [RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) scripting language and [Botpress](https://botpress.io/) platform. 

Aqua's core functionality is built upon providing new students at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) to have an easy, seamless experience to find their classrooms/buildings from their scheduler.
